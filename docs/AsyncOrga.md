# The Solution Explained

## The Module Loader pattern solves the "null reference" problem by:

Central Registry: All modules register themselves in a central place
Dependency Waiting: Modules can wait for their dependencies before executing
Safe Access: Use window.useModule() or window.useModules() to safely access other modules

## Key Benefits:

No more null errors: Code only runs when dependencies are available
Clear dependencies: You can see what each module needs
Works with file system: No special bundler needed
Async-safe: Handles timing issues automatically
